# OpenGL-Boiler-Plate

* The main idea behind this repo is to have an easy way to write OpenGL code (for myself) and start new projects
* Using this boiler plate system is fast, easy and takes care of all the required OpenGL initialization one would have to go
  through and allows the user to jump straight into rendering, Yay!
* The only thing you need to do per project is:
    - change the width, height and name of the window in Utils.h
    - define any attributes / methods your program needs in App.h
    - fill in App.cpp and render to your hearts desire
